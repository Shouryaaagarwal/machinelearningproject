# ðŸŽ¯ Lead Scoring Machine Learning Project

This project builds a predictive **Lead Scoring Model** that helps businesses identify and prioritize high-potential leads based on historical lead behavior and features. The goal is to **optimize marketing and sales efforts** by focusing on leads most likely to convert.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

- **Problem Statement**: Many businesses receive thousands of leads daily. Manually evaluating them is inefficient. This project automates the lead qualification process using data-driven insights.
- **Solution**: A supervised machine learning classification model that scores leads based on historical data and predicts the likelihood of conversion.

## ðŸ§  Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Removed multicollinearity
- Scaled numerical features

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Uncovered correlations between features and lead conversion
- Visualized trends, patterns, and distributions

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new meaningful variables
- Selected top predictive features using feature importance & correlation

### 4. Model Training
- Compared models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation

### 5. Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Classification Report
- Final model selected based on **precision-recall trade-off**

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Achieved **[Insert Your Final Accuracy or AUC Score]% accuracy**
- Final model helped rank leads into:
  - High probability of conversion
  - Medium
  - Low
